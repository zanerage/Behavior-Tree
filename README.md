AI Behavior Tree Example for Unity



Getting Started:

• Clone the repository.
• Open the project in Unity.
• Use Unity's built-in tools to visualize the AI detection range and behavior transitions.


Usage:

• AIController: Manages the AI's behavior using a behavior tree.
• PlayerController: Enables player movement via keyboard input (WASD or arrow keys).
• CameraFollow: Keeps the camera above the player for a top-down view.
• Detection Range Visualization: Displays the detection range around the AI in the Unity editor for easy debugging.
